MeanRabbit.com (http://www.meanrabbit.com) for the ambient sound you hear in the low-g chambrer (mr_ prefix). I emailed them about using their sounds in my maps, and they were very cool about it.

Banana, who did the low-g signs for Hayt a long time ago I believe.


------Additional Info and Notes-------------------------------

Hayt/Wintermute gave me the source files to finish this map up a long time ago. I think it was based on something from the scifi novel "Ender's Game". I fixed the rspeeds, then went back to spice up the texturing, lighting etc. I also did the other needed files (res, ini, loc, etc.). I think you'll find it an enjoyable little map.

------Map Instructions-----------------------------------------------

Text Display:
You will notice a text display on your right. This is a feature I added to make it easy to know where you were, and easier to find other players in small games. The map is roughly divided into 3 Tiers, Tier 1 being the lowest. The display indicates which Tiers of the map have players on them. The Tier that you are on yourself will be in White text. Other Tiers that have players will appear in Red text. Note that if another player is on the same Tier as you, all you will see is the White text you normally would were you alone on that Tier.

Single Player:
There are grunts, assassins, and some Zen monsters to battle in 1player. Just load the map in console. You can also get some nicer grunt models on my website, http://www.cryotank.net/maps/misc
