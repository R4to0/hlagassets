Have fun playing :) 

Story:

The Retrostation is a secret laboratory located 1,500 miles deep in the ground.

The Station is mostly empty because all research has finished and it acts more like a museum.
Some terrorists have just entered the station, the counter-terrorists have no idea why and what they want there.
So try to find out :)
