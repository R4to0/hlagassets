Superman info
---------------->
*-->Time took to create:  on and off for a couple of months.

*-->Time took to compile:  about 20 mins.

*-->Special Areas: When you step on the 'Fly Zone' logo underneath the giant superman symbol, you will fly through the city towards the RPG.

*-->Concept: I saw the Snarkpit had a mapping competition and figured I would get in.  The contest required each map to have a specific theme.  I went with flat shaded textures and a superman theme. Also worth mentioning, this map has a few areas that simulate flying.  One is indoors over a pit and the other is up high in the city.

*-->Weapons: All weapons but the egon and snark are included.

*-->Bots: I have included waypoints using the HPB bot tools.

*-->Sounds
The music played throughout the map is from the Superman movies.  The audio commentary heard in various parts of the map comes from the Superman cartoons. 

*-->Models
I grabbed the superman model out of an old mod from 2001-2002 called Battle of the Millenium.

*-->Textures
All are included in the .bsp. A majority of them are from the official superman website.

*-->Sky
I grabbed this sky off of the Wadfather website.
