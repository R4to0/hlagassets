Map Info

This map was created for the Snarkpit mapping competition.  The theme was concept-art based maps.  Included in my this zip file, is my reference image, 
created by Craig Mullins wwww.goodbrush.com.

---resources---

Textures:  A handful of Counterstrike and TFC textures were used as a base for modification.
           Some great wood textures were found at www.shaderlab.com
           I used quite a few images from various websites, using a google image search.  Unfortunately, I did not 
           document each site for reference.  If anyone sees an image they should be credited for, please contact
           me, and I will be happy to do so.

Sounds:    I downloaded and modified 2 wav files, of asian music, and monk-chants from  http://www.ibiblio.org/chinese-music/html/traditional.html

Concept art:  Craig Mullins, one of my favorite artists, was the inspiration for this map.  His imagery
              can be found at www.goodbrush.com
