In this map are a lot of secrets. There are four of them.
You wanna find them, when notice the following things:
no rpg? no egon? no snarks? no bunch of a mp with granades and ammo?
This can not be in a map from [HLW]Wolf!?!?
Don´t worry! This toys are all in there somewhere!!!
Look for them and have fun with the killing tools hehe.


This map can be reviewed on our page http://hlw.gametown.de soon.
