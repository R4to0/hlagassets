------Release Notes - Version 2 -------------------------------------

I've made this new version of the map after playing Rats! on-line.
The main change I've made is to have moved the Egon/Gluon gun from
the sink into the icebox. This means you've got to suffer a bit to
get it, which seems fair.

The RPG that was in the icebox is now in the sink and the sink-side
trigger for the garbage disposal mechanism is now walk-over instead
of "Use" only, making it much easier to use.

There are a couple of minor bugfixes too, but nothing major.

------Play Information-----------------------------------------------

Deathmatch	: Yes - 24 starts defined.
Single Player	: No.
Map Description	: Small Fraggers...

The map is either set in a giant kitchen or in a normal size kitchen
with tiny players, depending on your point of view. OK, so it's a
gimmicky idea, but I have tried to make it work as a DM map. Try it
out and you'll find that at least it makes a change from endless
bases, warehouses and canyons...

I've defined 24 DM starts (for variety), but I reckon things would
get pretty hectic with that many people. Because the map is centered
around one main "arena", it would probably work quite well for a
small number of players (they wouldn't wander around forever waiting
to catch sight of another player).

The theme and the scale of the players means that r_speeds can get
high in the open spaces (I've seen a peak of just over 700), but
most fast machines should be able to cope with this. If you're
wondering why there's not much stuff lying around on the kitchen
surfaces and table, it's to try keep the r_speeds down. Obviously
I could have had all kinds of fun kitchen applicances sitting around,
but it wouldn't have been playable.

The map could be fun for teamplay, but I haven't been able to try it.
As far as I can see, there are two main bases:- the main cupboard
with four entry points (2 floor, 1 mid level, 1 high) and some nice
weaponry; and a combination of the cupboard under the sink and the
fridge, which has quite a few entry points (3 floor, 1 mid level, 1
high), and a fairly healthy arsenal.

Note: If the map is run with realistic falling damage set on there
will probably be a lot of broken bones and splattered bodies around
as the vertical drops are very high (it's easy to get confused
and think "Hey, it's just a kitchen worktop, I can jump off here..."
and forget that it's equivalent to a five storey building). It still
works, but gameplay is easier with the default setting (normal dmg).

Known Bugs:
None.
