Map Description	: Small Fraggers3

Rats3 is the third room in the Rats! series of DM maps. The setting this
time is a kid's bedroom.

Although this map has lower r_speeds than Rats2/RatsXL, they are still
higher than the ideal for deathmatch due to the nature of the setting.
This means that the map is not well-suited to software mode or being
run on old machines.

Note: As with the previous Rats maps, this map should not be run with
realistic falling damage set on. Gameplay is much better with the
default setting (normal dmg).

Known Bugs:
A bug in Half-Life itself means that if a player is killed or displaced
whilst firing the laser cannon on the U.F.O. the beam will stay active.
There's nothing I can do about this, so live with it.

Features:
You should be aware that the air-lift tube will blow items up the shaft,
including satchel charges, hand grenades, snarks and trip-mines.

Incidentally, I implemented the lightswitch in this map after many
requests from people. I've often heard it said that switchable lights
in maps lead to lower framerates but after making this map with and
without this feature I could see absolutely no difference in r_speeds
or framerate between the two versions.
