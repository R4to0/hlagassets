Map Description         : I couldn't decide what sky to use, and when asking people they asked me
			  the theme - which I had given little though! So here's my late addition
			  of a background story, a first for me so excuse the lameness...

			    "A large corporation responsible for transporting all kinds of cargo
			    across the universe built this base on a motionless asteroid for the
			    purpose of being a midway station between the worlds of Xen and Earth.
			    In its hayday a thriving refueling station, servicing dozens of ships
			    each day, the base became more infrequently visited as the technology
			    to travel large distances in shorter times was developed. Eventually
			    funding was cut from the project and it was abandoned. Bought over by
			    the US government, it is now used by the military as an off-world
			    training ground."
			
			It is a medium sized DM map suited for between 2 and 8 players.

Misc Author Info        : This is my sixth map release. I am currently 18 [at 15/08/02] and live 
			  in Scotland in a little town called North Berwick where i skateboard,
			  map and piss about on computers. Sometime i hope to gain a career in a
			  level design...nothing wrong with optimism :) In spetember I'm off to Uni
			  to get myself a degree in "Computer Games Technology" so it's a step in
			  the right direction!
